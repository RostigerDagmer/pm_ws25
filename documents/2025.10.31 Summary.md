## Data

##### - Script for downloading all data linked at processmining.org
##### - torch Dataloaders on top of pm4py for:

XES
CSV
Process Models
- covers all discovery methods
- covers parameter grids for all discovery methods
- organizes discovery by ability to produce sound networks

_All are agnostic to feature extraction_

#### Basic dataset analysis:

Simple statistics for all dataset:
- avg. trace length
- number of unique activities
- number of traces
- activity frequency

 Useful for configuring CSV datasets.
 E.g.:
 BPI2016_Clicks...
 BPI2016_Complaints
 likely not yet configured correctly.
 TODOs:
- Mine for all valid configurations of CSV datasets.
##### Analysis of mined Process Models

in progress...

**Preliminary:**
There does not seem to be huge diversity from Parameter sweeps.
Deduplication Strategies?
_see:_
`experiments/dataset/survey/net_stats.ipynb`
`experiments/dataset/survey/petri_atlas`

TODOs:
- speed up discovery... already naively parallel but still slow.

## Detour
### Synthetic Data

- [[Block-structured nets]]
- [[Simulator]]
